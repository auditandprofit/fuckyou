Here are the big buckets:

* **How the pieces talk**: the step-by-step flow and handoffs between stages.
* **Running code safely**: how the agent executes checks, sandboxing, no-network, read-only.
* **Talking to the LLM**: prompts, tool schemas, retries, model/version pinning, caching.
* **Proof of findings**: what evidence you store (file, lines, hash, snippet) and how you keep it stable.
* **Repeatable runs**: locking configs, recording git state, making results reproducible.
* **Failure handling**: timeouts, backoff, graceful errors, recovery paths.
* **Speed and cost**: concurrency, batching, de-duping work, token/time budgets.
* **Visibility**: logs, live progress, metrics, and a clean final report.
* **Data shapes & checks**: strict JSON/Pydantic models everywhere; consistent event names.
* **Security boundaries**: trusted binaries, path validation, secret handling.
* **Config & release**: flags/env, CI/CD, versioning, reproducible builds.
* **Testing & evals**: unit/integration tests, golden runs, regression gates, small accuracy suite.
